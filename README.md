# Roundcube IMAPsync

A Roundcube plugin that pulls mail from a remote IMAP server into the currently logged-in
Roundcube account. Built for the one-shot account-migration case: you sit in your new mailbox,
enter your old server's credentials, click Start, and watch your folders and messages stream in.

The synchronization runs natively in PHP on top of Roundcube's own `rcube_imap_generic` client.
There is no Perl `imapsync` binary, no background daemon, no extra runtime dependency.

> **Status:** MVP. Synchronous execution suitable for small to medium mailboxes. Background-worker
> mode for large migrations is on the roadmap — see [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

---

## Features

- **Settings-section UI.** A new "Email migration" entry appears in Roundcube's Settings; no extra
  menus or buttons clutter the rest of the interface.
- **PHP-native sync.** Walks every folder on the source, recreates missing folders on the
  destination preserving hierarchy, and appends only the messages that are not already there.
- **Idempotent dedup.** A second run against the same source skips everything already copied,
  using `Message-ID + size` (with a subject/date/size fallback for messages that lack a
  `Message-ID`).
- **Result summary.** When the sync finishes, the page shows folders synced, messages copied,
  skipped, and any per-message errors. (Live mid-run progress is intentionally not exposed in
  this MVP — see [Known limitations](#known-limitations).)
- **TLS by default.** Plaintext IMAP is refused unless an administrator opts in via config.
- **Host allow/deny lists.** Administrators can restrict which remote servers users can sync
  from.
- **No password persistence.** Source credentials live in the PHP session for one job and are
  wiped immediately after the sync returns.

---

## Requirements

- **Roundcube 1.6.0 or newer** (tested against 1.7.0).
- **PHP 8.1+** with the `imap` extension available — Roundcube already needs it, so this is a
  given on any working Roundcube install.
- Composer (only required if you want to run the test suite or pull dev dependencies).

## Installation

### Drop-in release tarball (recommended)

Every tagged release publishes a ready-to-unpack tarball and zip on the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/mittwald/Roundcube-IMAPsync/releases).
The archive root is `imapsync/`, so it extracts straight into Roundcube's
`plugins/` directory — no composer, no git, no extra steps.

```bash
cd /path/to/roundcubemail/plugins
# Replace v0.1.0 with the latest tag from the Releases page.
curl -L -o imapsync.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/mittwald/Roundcube-IMAPsync/releases/download/v0.1.0/roundcube-imapsync-0.1.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf imapsync.tar.gz
rm imapsync.tar.gz
```

A SHA-256 checksum file is published alongside each archive — verify it with
`sha256sum -c roundcube-imapsync-<version>.sha256` if you care about supply-chain
integrity.

### Via Composer

```bash
cd /path/to/roundcubemail
composer require mittwald/imapsync
```

Roundcube's `plugin-installer` will drop the plugin into `plugins/imapsync/`.

### From a git checkout (development)

```bash
cd /path/to/roundcubemail/plugins
git clone https://github.com/mittwald/Roundcube-IMAPsync imapsync
```

### Enabling the plugin

Whichever install path you chose, enable the plugin in
`config/config.inc.php`:

```php
$config['plugins'] = [
    // ... your existing plugins
    'imapsync',
];
```

Optionally copy and edit the plugin configuration:

```bash
cp plugins/imapsync/config.inc.php.dist plugins/imapsync/config.inc.php
```

Reload Roundcube. A new **Email migration** entry appears under Settings.

---

## Usage

1. Open Roundcube, log in to the account that should **receive** the mail.
2. Go to **Settings → Email migration**.
3. Enter the **source** server's host, port, encryption, username and password.
4. Click **Verify migration**. A checklist appears showing whether the source is reachable,
   how many folders were found, and whether the destination has enough free space (estimated
   from source size with a 15% safety margin). The **Start migration** button is disabled
   until this check passes (or quota information is unavailable, in which case it unlocks
   anyway with a warning).
5. Click **Start migration**. The browser shows a "loading" indicator until the run finishes.
6. When the run completes, the page shows a summary (folders migrated, messages copied,
   messages skipped, errors).
7. Open your inbox — the migrated folders and messages are there.

If the destination mailbox is full mid-run, the sync stops immediately with a clear
"target mailbox is full" message instead of producing one error per source message.

### Re-running against the same source

Running the sync twice is safe. The second run sees the messages already in the destination,
detects duplicates by `Message-ID + size`, and skips them. Only new messages on the source are
copied.

### Cancelling

Closing the browser tab is **not** a reliable way to cancel. Depending on the PHP and
webserver configuration, the run may keep going server-side until it finishes — or it may
be killed by `max_execution_time` / a webserver read timeout partway through. Either way
the user loses the result summary, and a partially-completed run cannot be observed. A
"Cancel" button is on the roadmap but not in this MVP.

## Configuration

All settings live in `plugins/imapsync/config.inc.php` (copy from `config.inc.php.dist`). Defaults
are safe to leave alone; override only what you need.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `imapsync_allow_insecure` | `bool` | `false` | Allow plaintext IMAP as a source encryption choice. **Leave off in production.** |
| `imapsync_host_allowlist` | `string[]` | `[]` | If non-empty, the source host must match one of these patterns (substring match). |
| `imapsync_host_denylist` | `string[]` | `[]` | Source hosts matching any of these patterns are refused. |
| `imapsync_skip_folders` | `string[]` | `[]` | Folder names on the source to skip globally. |
| `imapsync_folder_prefix` | `string` | `''` | Prefix to prepend to destination folder paths (useful when you want all synced folders to land under e.g. `Imported/`). |

## Security

- **Passwords are never written to disk.** Source credentials enter the form, get used by the
  sync engine, and are wiped from the PHP session as soon as the engine returns — success or
  failure.
- **No logging of credentials.** Neither PHP's `error_log` nor Roundcube's `errors.log` ever see
  the source password or username in cleartext.
- **TLS is the default.** Plaintext IMAP requires an explicit admin opt-in
  (`imapsync_allow_insecure`).
- **Host gating.** Administrators can pin acceptable source hosts via the allow/deny lists, e.g.
  to confine a migration window to a single legacy server.

If you find a security-relevant issue, please open an issue on GitHub — or, for sensitive
reports, email the maintainer directly.

## Development

This repository is the **plugin source**, not a full Roundcube checkout. The `dist/` directory
holds a local copy of the Roundcube release used as a reference while developing (API
signatures, plugin patterns) — it is gitignored.

### Bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mittwald/Roundcube-IMAPsync
cd Roundcube-IMAPsync
composer install
```

### Running tests

```bash
composer test:unit          # in-memory unit tests, no network, no Docker
composer test:integration   # Dovecot integration suite, requires a running Docker daemon
composer test               # alias for test:unit
```

The unit tests do not touch the network — the sync engine takes an injected IMAP-client
interface (`RoundcubeImapSyncClient`) and the suite uses an in-memory fake
(`tests/Fakes/FakeImapClient.php`).

The integration suite spins up two real Dovecot containers via
[`testcontainers-php`](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-php) and skips itself
cleanly if Docker is not available.

### Fetching the Roundcube reference tree

```bash
composer dist:fetch
```

Downloads Roundcube 1.7.0 into `dist/` (idempotent — no-op if it's already there). The
`dist/` tree is gitignored and only used as a read-only reference while developing the plugin.

### Conventions

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the binding code conventions, naming rules, things-not-to-do
list, and architectural decisions. AI coding assistants (Claude, Codex, etc.) are expected to
read it first; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to the same file so any tool that auto-loads project
context picks it up.

## Known limitations

- **Synchronous execution.** The sync runs inside the HTTP request that started it. Very large
  mailboxes can hit PHP `max_execution_time` or browser timeouts. A background-worker mode with
  resumable jobs is the planned next iteration.
- **No mid-run progress.** The browser sits on a "loading" indicator until the sync finishes
  and then shows the full summary. Live per-folder progress requires either a worker process
  or out-of-session progress storage; both are planned as part of the worker-mode rewrite.
- **No resume.** A failed sync has to be restarted from the top. Idempotent dedup means already-
  copied messages are skipped fast, but the folder walk still happens.
- **No `CONDSTORE` / `QRESYNC`.** Incremental syncs are correct but not as cheap as they could
  be on servers that support these IMAP extensions.
- **Quota handling is best-effort.** The "Verify migration" check estimates source size against
  destination free quota with a 15% safety margin, and a runtime `[OVERQUOTA]` response stops
  the sync immediately with a clear message. The verify check cannot help if the destination
  server has no `QUOTA` extension (it then reports "unknown") or if the destination fills up
  from external activity between verify and start.
- **Elastic skin only.** The legacy `classic` skin is not targeted.
